**My Motivation:**

After quitting my job from *Application (R&D) Scientist* at Bay instrument, I kinda slow down my career development and become a stay-at-home mom. I do really enjoy the time with my baby boy, but the feeling of depression and anxiety comes and goes. Being a full-time mom is lack of appreciation or a missing sense of accomplishment compared to what I did before as PhD and/or Scientist. So, I want to change the daily schedule for myself, for a better future, after my boy go to preK. Here I commit myself to take [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://https://www.100daysofcode.com/) where I spend at least one hour coding for 100 days (in a row).

Jane Goodall once said:
> What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide
> what kind of difference you want to make.

My big motivation for taking this challenge is **Learn to Code** to make a difference in changing people's life.

**This Is My Main Goals:**
<ul>1. Complete all <strong>FreeCampCode</strong> Certificate</ul>
<ul>2. Run my own Tech blog</ul>
<ul>3. Learn Deep Learning in Python</ul>
<ul>4. Prepare AWS SA Associated certificate</ul>

Sounds like a crazy plan while nursing a baby. But at least I'd love to give it a try. I really like to keep up the updated pace of tech outside of world. So, I will be ready while it's time to let go my kid(s). Here I diversify the goals from web language, python to cloud computing AWS service. Hopefully, more project ideas could be done after `100DaysOfCode` Challenge. Let see what I can do.
