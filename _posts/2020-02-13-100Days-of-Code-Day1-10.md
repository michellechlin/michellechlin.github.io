After quitting my job from R&D scientist, I become a stay-at-home mom. Although I have more time with my child, the depressed feeling comes and goes a being a full-time mom is lack of appreciation or a missing sense of accomplishment. So, I commit myself to take [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://https://www.100daysofcode.com/) where I spend at least one hour coding for 100 days.

**This is my main goals:**
