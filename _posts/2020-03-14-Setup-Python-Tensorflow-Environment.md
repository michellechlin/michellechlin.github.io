As I am thinking of self-learning Machine Learning (ML), I want to quickly pick up the skills and foundation of Python. *(I used more with R, Matlab during my PhD work)*. So, since last year when I was at 9-month pregnancy, I've completed [Python for Data Science and ML Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/), instructed by Jose Portilla. Today, I have some sorts of feeling that I know what I was doing as a mom (~ 6 months after giving birth). Then, I grab and read a book *The Algebra of Happiness*, make a coffee, and open my MacBook - thinking, I'd like to continue to learn more about ML as I have been always fascinated with data. In between my baby sleep-wake cycle, I read and code and write down what I did, even just a little bit.

On Saturday March 14, the world is fighting with coronavirus and my world is thrilling that I start the journey of learning new things, from this course [Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/).

Hopefully, I can start making fun project soon through applying what I've learned every single time I have when my baby fall asleep and/or take a nap. Here I make notes of every steps and accomplishment, **even just a little bit**.

## TensorFlow Setup and Install

**Here are the notes for myself:**

* Downland Python 3.7 Version from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for MacOS
* Create a folder, named "TensorFlow" under Desktop/Gitproject/
* Downland the class materials into the created folder

**What I should do next time for STARTING the course:**

* Locate the path in terminal with this code `% cd Desktop/Gitproject/TensorFlow`
* Open terminal and type `% conda activate mytfenv`for setup TensorFlow Environment
* Get into virtual env using `% jupyter notebook`
