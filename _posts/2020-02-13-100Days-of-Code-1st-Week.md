**My Motivation:**

After quitting my job from *Application (R&D) Scientist* at Bay instrument, I kinda slow down my career development and become a stay-at-home mom. I do really enjoy the time with my baby boy, but the feeling of depression and anxiety comes and goes. Being a full-time mom is lack of appreciation or a missing sense of accomplishment compared to what I did before as PhD and/or Scientist. So, I want to change the daily schedule for myself, for a better future, after my boy go to preK. Here I commit myself to take [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://https://www.100daysofcode.com/) where I spend at least one hour coding for 100 days (in a row).

Jane Goodall once said:
> What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide
> what kind of difference you want to make.

My big motivation for taking this challenge is **Learn to Code** to make a difference in changing people's life.
