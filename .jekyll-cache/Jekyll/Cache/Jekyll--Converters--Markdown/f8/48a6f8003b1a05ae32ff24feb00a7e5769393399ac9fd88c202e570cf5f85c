<p><strong>My Motivation:</strong></p>

<p>After quitting my job from <em>Application (R&amp;D) Scientist</em> at Bay instrument, I kinda slow down my career development and become a stay-at-home mom. I do really enjoy the time with my baby boy, but the feeling of depression and anxiety comes and goes. Being a full-time mom is lack of appreciation or a missing sense of accomplishment compared to what I did before as PhD and/or Scientist. So, I want to change the daily schedule for myself, for a better future, after my boy go to preK. Here I commit myself to take <a href="https://https://www.100daysofcode.com/">100 Days of Code Challenge</a> where I spend at least one hour coding for 100 days (in a row).</p>

<p>Jane Goodall once said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide
what kind of difference you want to make.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My big motivation for taking this challenge is <strong>Learn to Code</strong> to make a difference in changing people’s life.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>This Is My Main Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>1. Complete all <strong>FreeCampCode</strong> Certificate</ul>
<ul>2. Run my own Tech blog</ul>
<ul>3. Learn Deep Learning in Python</ul>
<ul>4. Prepare AWS SA Associated certificate</ul>
<hr />

<p>Sounds like a crazy plan while nursing a baby. But at least I give it a try. I really like to keep up the tech outside of world. So, I will always feel confident going back to work in two-three years later. Here, I diversify the goals from web language, python to cloud computing AWS service. Hopefully, more projects could be done after all those commitments for <code class="highlighter-rouge">100DaysOfCode</code> Challenge. Let’s see what a crazy mom can do.</p>
